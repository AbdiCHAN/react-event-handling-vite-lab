# React Event Handling – Password Input Lab

This project is a React application built with Vite to practice event handling, component structure, and testing. The application includes a password input component that logs a message to the console when the user types, and a submit button that logs messages when the mouse enters and leaves the button. The goal of this lab is to understand React event listeners, state updates, and how to test component interactions using Vitest and React Testing Library.
